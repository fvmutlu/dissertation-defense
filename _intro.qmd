## Further Considerations {.smaller visibility="uncounted"}

-  Benefits of caching more pronounced when caching and forwarding decisions are tightly coupled[^coupling].
    -  Even more critical with larger, slower caches: traffic should be diverted intelligently so congestion is balanced.
-  Caches are not free to use; each operation has an energy cost.

-  Caches are not free to use; each operation has an energy cost.
    -  SSDs also wear out over time as their contents are overwritten.

::: {.notes}
- Now of course the capacity challenge is not the only obstacle in our way. There's another major consideration which is operational costs.
- Caches are not free to use, each admission and replacement, and even idle operation has a real cost in energy so if we're adding even more cache devices we have to be mindful of this cost.
- Finally, we look at the question of how can we make sure we're actually making the most of caches in the network?
- Because, now that we're adding larger caches that are difficult to operate, and also adding costs into the equation, we really want to make sure we're getting the benefits.
- This is where the act of tying caching and forwarding together comes in.

## Goal & Contributions

Develop a joint forwarding and caching policy that:

-   Tracks user demand for objects as basis for decisions.
-   Utilizes diverse cache resources effectively:
    -   Ensures devices are receiving [sustainable hit rates]{.body-highlight}.
    -   Makes [high-value]{.body-highlight} replacement decisions.
-   Utilizes bandwidth resources effectively:
    -   Steers requests toward caching points.
    -   Forwards requests avoiding congestion.
