- **Problem:** Distribution of massive data for data-intensive science experiments.
- **Solution:** High-performance NDN-based data delivery system.

**Cache capacity challenge:** 20 GB of DRAM space allocated at each node.

- DRAM is fast but small and expensive; NVMe is cheap and large but slow.
- Logical next step: use both!
- **Challenge:** "Novel multi-tier caching algorithms are required."[^ndndpdk]

-   DRAM is the standard cache device due its speed; but is expensive, has limited capacity and contended for.
-   Next best option is NVMe SSD; is cheap and has large capacity, but much slower than DRAM.
-   Logical next step: use both!
