# Hello 2

For servicenet example, with N=1000, s=0.75 and 90 obj/sec coming into the forwarder:

-   With no cache, there are on average 9 packets waiting at the server-forwarder link
-   With 10 obj. cache, cache takes roughly 18 hits, there are on average 2.5 packets (%72 reduction)
-   With 50 obj. cache, cache takes roughly 34 hits, there are on average 1.25 packets (%86 reduction)
-   With 100 obj. cache, cache takes roughly 44 hits, there are on average 0.85 packets (%95 reduction)
