# Introduction

{{< include _intro.qmd >}}

# System Model

::: {.notes}
That concludes the introduction and leads me into the system model that we're dealing with.

{{< include _model.qmd >}}

# Virtual Plane Optimization

::: {.notes}
With the system model described, we will now look at our control algorithm in the virtual plane.
:::

{{< include _vp.qmd >}}

# Data Plane Strategy

::: {.notes}
- So there are several things about applying this virtual plane algorithm within the mechanics of the data plane
- Most obvious is that virtual plane decisions are made in discrete time slots, but of course the data plane decisions have to be reactive and continuous
- (Next slide)

# Experiments

::: {.notes}
- Alright, so how does our strategy fare in experimental evaluations

# Conclusion & Other Work

## Conclusion

::: {.incremental}
-   We address a critical and practical problem in scaling high-throughput caching networks
-   Our proposed model and approach achieves our goals and performs decently, but has shortcomings
-   Some improvements can be made by reiterating on technical details, further fine tuning requires experimentation

Conclusion & Other Work

::: {.notes}
- I should also note that we submitted a paper on this to MobiHoc last year which was rejected
- We're currently revising the paper for the upcoming ICC
