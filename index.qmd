## Overview {visibility="uncounted"}

- [Primary Contribution:]{.body-highlight} Joint *multi-tiered caching* and forwarding policy.
    - **Context**: Information-centric networking (ICN), in-network caching.
    - **Motivation**: Data volume grows exponentially, cache capacities need to scale.
    - **Challenge**: Operating larger caches efficiently is difficult.
    - **Goal**: Policies that observe cache characteristics to address this challenge.

# Introduction {visibility="uncounted"}

# System Model {visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.notes}
That concludes the introduction and leads me into the system model that we're dealing with.

# Virtual Plane Optimization {visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.notes}
With the system model described, we will now look at our control algorithm in the virtual plane.

# Data Plane Strategy {visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.notes}
- So there are several things about applying this virtual plane algorithm within the mechanics of the data plane
- Most obvious is that virtual plane decisions are made in discrete time slots, but of course the data plane decisions have to be reactive and continuous
- (Next slide)

# Experiments {visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.notes}
- Alright, so how does our strategy fare in experimental evaluations

## Summary

::: {.incremental}
-   We address a critical and practical problem in scaling high-throughput caching networks
-   Our proposed model and approach achieves our goals and performs decently, but has shortcomings
-   Some improvements can be made by reiterating on technical details, further fine tuning requires experimentation
