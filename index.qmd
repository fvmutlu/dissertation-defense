# Introduction {visibility="uncounted"}

{{< include _intro.qmd >}}

# System Model {visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.notes}
Now, let's review the system model we're targeting with this work.
:::

{{< include _model.qmd >}}

# Virtual Plane Optimization {visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.notes}
- So having reviewed the model, we'll now review the process of building a joint caching and forwarding policy, which begins in the virtual plane.
:::

{{< include _vp.qmd >}}

# Data Plane Strategy {visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.notes}
- So there are several things about applying this virtual plane algorithm within the mechanics of the data plane
- Most obvious is that virtual plane decisions are made in discrete time slots, but of course the data plane decisions have to be reactive and continuous
- (Next slide)

{{< include _dp.qmd >}}

# Experiments {visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.notes}
- Alright, so how does our strategy fare in experimental evaluations
:::

{{< include _exp.qmd >}}

# Virtual Plane Cache Read Rate Control {visibility="uncounted"}

::: {.notes}
- With that detailed coverage of experiments done, I want to quickly discuss another venue I explored that leads to a variant on our policy.

## Summary of Contributions {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- Object-level multi-tiered caching model incorporating cache tiers with diverse cost and performance parameters.
- Extensions of the VIP framework and algorithm with this caching model:
    - Optimal trade-off of queue backlogs and cache utilization penalties.
    - Variant that explicitly controls cache read rate allocations in the virtual plane.
- Data plane multi-tiered caching policies guided by the virtual control plane algorithms.
- Extensive experimental evaluation of said policies under numerous simulation settings.
- A lightweight object-level ICN simulator built to be extensible and equipped with convenience features to allow future research and experimentation.

Summary

::: {.notes}
- I should also note that we submitted a paper on this to MobiHoc last year which was rejected
- We're currently revising the paper for the upcoming ICC
