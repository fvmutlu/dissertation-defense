# Introduction
<h3>Background</h3>

## Information Centric Networking

- **Motivation**: Internet today is primarily a data distribution network, yet its principles are those of a communication network
- **Core Premise**: Make uniquely named data the primary entity of the network, instead of endpoints
- **Advantages**: Improve efficiency and scalability by decoupling data from location and session

## In-network Caching

- **Motivation**: Current caching infrastructure is mostly proprietary and centralized
- **Core Premise**: Enable every router in the network to maintain its own cache
- **Advantages**: Caching becomes decentralized, reducing network congestion and improving scalability

## Wireless Edge & HetNets

- Interface between local devices and wider network infrastructure
- Many edge devices are connected wirelessly and through various access technologies (HetNet)
- **Importance**: Edge-computing is gaining prevalance, driving more computation towards the network edge
